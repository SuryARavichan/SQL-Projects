## Project Overview
This project uses a detailed sales database of Walmart store transactions. It includes data on invoices, branches, customer demographics, product lines, pricing, taxes, and payment methods. The main objectives are to:
- Analyze total sales and revenue by city, branch, and product line
- Evaluate customer types and buying behaviors
- Assess monthly revenue trends and cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Calculate average VAT, ratings, and product popularity
- Use advanced SQL queries for data aggregation and reporting

## Features
- Comprehensive sales data schema covering multiple dimensions like customer, product, and time
- SQL queries with aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT) and grouping for insightful business intelligence
- Use of date and time functions to analyze monthly trends
- Filtering and ranking of branches and products based on sales and quantity
- Support for understanding payment methods and customer segments

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:


2. Import the `walmart_analysis.sql` file into your SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
3. Ensure your database supports PostgreSQL functions like `to_char` for date formatting.
4. Use any SQL client or IDE to run queries and perform analysis.

## Usage
- Connect to the database using a SQL client.
- Execute the provided SQL scripts to create the `sales` table and load data.
- Run analytical queries to generate insights on sales, revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.
- Customize queries to fit specific analytical needs or business questions.

## Database Schema
The `sales` table includes the following key columns:
- `invoice_id` (PK): Unique sales transaction identifier
- `branch`, `city`: Store location details
- `customer_type`, `gender`: Customer demographics
- `product_line`: Category of the purchased product
- `unit_price`, `quantity`: Pricing and quantity sold
- `VAT`, `total`, `cogs`, `gross_income`: Financial metrics
- `date`, `time`: Sale timestamp
- `payment_method`: Payment type used
- `gross_margin_pct`, `rating`: Profit margin and customer rating
